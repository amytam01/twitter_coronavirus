# Coronavirus analysis

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on Twitter sent in 2020 by using geotagged tweets with coronavirus related hashtags (for example:: #coronavirus, #covid, #covid19). Specifically, we organized tweets by language and country, as to better understand the spread of coronavirus through Twitter. One of the many insights which we can derive through this project is that the US had the most geotagged tweets with coronavirus related hashtags of all countries, and that most of the geotagged tweets which used a coronavirus related hashtag were in English (followed by Spanish).

In building this project, I was able to work with a large scale dataset (about 1.1 billion tweets) with multilingual text, and run my commands in parallel even when I was offline through writing a script.
